# StaticClipper

## Description

An oversampling option with different factors has also been implemented to reduce aliasing. 

## Future Improvements  
In the future, the plugin will provide ADAA method to more effectively reduce aliasing.

An option to add some coloration to the sound before the whaveshaping stage will also be provide, trying to simulate the caracterical sound of some active amplifictaion and filtering stage of famous distortion pedals.
